# Sorting-Visualizer
A simple Java Application through which you can visualize how sorting over an array works.
<br>
I have used java swing framework in my application and added some buttons to perform the sorting operations.
whenever you clicked a button, it will perform the sorting operation and all other button will get set to non clickable until the operation is completed.<br>
After completing the operation, there is a shuffle button for shuffling the array to do the operations again.
<br><br>
I have implemented following sorting algorithms.
<br>
`1.Insertion Sort`
<br>
`2.Quick Sort`
<br>
`3.Bubble Sort`
<br>
`4.Selection Sort`
<br>
`5.Merge Sort`
<br><br>
Here is the implementation of one of the sorting algorithms.<br>
### `Quick sort`
